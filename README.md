## Important Notes
Due to some lighting issues, 3  mandala scans were not properly analysed. So I think we should skip these three or mention it in the paper that the analysis of these 3 were corrupted:
40152
40028
40027 


In your analysis, you can skip over the “total black pixels” as it’s irrelevant to the analysis. Since technically, black pixels are only borders and are not to be painted, they are usually ignored in the region detections. That’s why their value is so low.
