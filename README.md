## Important Notes
Due to some lighting issues, 3  mandala scans were not properly analysed:
40152
40028
40027 


In your analysis, you can skip over the “total black pixels” as it’s irrelevant to the analysis. Since technically, black pixels are only borders and are not to be painted, they are usually ignored in the region detections. That’s why their values are so low.


## More Info
Some of the scripts in `additional scripts` could be outdated but they offer insight into our procedure and progress over time.
